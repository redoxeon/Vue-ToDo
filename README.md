# Vue To-Do List

I used the Vue CLI template to get started on developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

I'm deploying this site with netlify and using my already owned domain! 

## MVP Reqs

- [x] View a list of to-do items
  - [x] with the ability to filter the list by pending, complete, and all to-dos
- [x] Create a new to-do item
- [x] Edit a to-do item
- [x] Delete a to-do item
- [x] Complete a to-do item
